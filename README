Utility for automatically uploading and publishing songs to SoundCloud after they've been mixed down in a DAW.

## Usage
Update the SOURCE_PATH in utils.py to reflect your default mixdown folder.
You can also override the VALID_SUFFIX if you don't mixdown in MP3. This is in place to disregard .DS_STORE and other non-valid formats.
